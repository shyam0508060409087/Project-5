📘 Week 5 Java Mini Projects – Linked List Applications
Welcome to the Week 5 Java Mini Projects Repository!
This week focused on applying core Linked List concepts through problem-solving and algorithm implementation. Below are the three mini-projects built with detailed descriptions.

🔹 1. Palindrome Linked List Checker
📄 Description
This program checks whether a given singly linked list is a palindrome or not. It uses the fast and slow pointer approach to find the middle of the list and then reverses the second half to compare both halves.

🧠 Concepts Used
Fast and slow pointer technique

Linked list reversal

Comparison of node values

✅ Sample Output
Is Palindrome: true

🔹 2. Find N-th Node From the End
📄 Description
A common interview question where the goal is to find the N-th node from the end of a singly linked list using a two-pointer approach.

🧠 Concepts Used
Two-pointer technique

Edge case handling

Efficient single-pass traversal

✅ Sample Output
2nd node from end: 40

🔹 3. Floyd's Cycle Detection (Hare-Tortoise Algorithm)
📄 Description
This project implements Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, also known as the Hare and Tortoise method, to detect a cycle (loop) in a linked list.

🧠 Concepts Used
Cycle detection using fast and slow pointers

Detecting repeated nodes in O(n) time and O(1) space

✅ Sample Output
Cycle detected: true
